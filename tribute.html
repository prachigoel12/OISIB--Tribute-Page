    <h2>India's Melody Queen, A Beacon Of Inspiration</h2>
    <p1>My heart is full of sorrow. India's melody queen, Lata Mangeshkar, is no more. She was not only the queen of Indian melody but also my sister. She was three years older than me, but I never called her Lata didi like the rest of the world because she always looked about eight years younger than me. We had a lot of good times together. Of course, every time she sang, my heart used to be full of absolute happiness. When she fell ill this time, I sent her a letter telling her the same. My wife and I had lovely evenings together with Lata. We often went to her house on Pedder Road and had some great meals.</p1>

        Lata Mangeshkar was born on September 28, 1929, in Indore.
        She was the eldest of the four siblings of Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar.
        Her father was a classical singer and a theatre artist. He was a great influence on her life.

        Lata Mangeshkar was a singer, actress, and composer. She was known for her melody voice.
        She sang in many languages including Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, and many more.<br><br>
        </p3>
        <p5>
        She said " Music knows no boundaries and transcends linguistic, cultural, and geographical limitations".

    <p2>I speak today with a hand on my grieving heart. What a lovely voice our Lataji had. It seemed as if god had poured some honey into her lovely renderings. Almost every song that she sang became a hit. My Radio Hit Parade Geetmala featured so many of her songs.

        Now that Lataji has passed away, the hearts of millions of music lovers all over the world must be singing for her that soulful film song, Tum kya jaano tumhari yaad mein hum kitna roye. With Lataâ€™s passing, a lot of lovely feelings in my heart have passed away. I do hope she sings in heaven and keeps it full of melody.</p2>
